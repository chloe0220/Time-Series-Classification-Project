# Time-Series-Classification-Project
In this problem, we need to classify the activities of humans based on time series obtained by a Wireless Sensor Network.
  
Datasets: Activity Recognition system based on Multisensor data fusion (AReM) Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Activity+Recognition+system+based+on+Multisensor+data+fusion+(AReM)
  
The dataset contains 7 folders that represent seven types of activities. In each folder, there are multiple files each of which represents an instant of a human performing an activity. Each file containis 6 time series collected from activities of the same person. There are 88 instances in the dataset, each of which contains 6 time series and each time series has 480 consecutive values.
